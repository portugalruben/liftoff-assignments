## Submission Instructions

### Overview
//Include overview here

The purpose of this project is to create a web app that performs basic data analysis (DA) tasks and simple
machine learning (ML) predictions, and display them in a variety of formats (at least, two).
The user can be a data scientist, an entrepreneur, or executive interested in extracting information from raw data.
The idea came from the fact that a lot of data scientists' time is spent in cleaning and wrangling data, tasks
that lend themselves to automation.

### Features

Features:

1) The app would have multiple users (who would create accounts) and each user would have the possibility to upload
several files to be analysed.
2) The information about what the user wants to do with the file (DA/ML) would be displayed and entered by the user
via either radiobuttons, drop down menus, checkboxes, etc.
3) The program performs the calculations required.
